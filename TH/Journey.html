            <h2>My Journey, So far...</h2>
            <p>My code journey begin when I started doing a course called ECDL which stands for European Computer Driving License.
            ECDL does teach a little bit of code but nothing more than very very basic level knowledge, this is what grabbed my interest
            in code. I completed my ECDL and then went onto a 2 year course at Stockport doing general computing which involved Visual
            Basic programming language. I successfully completed that course and discovered that I could enter into university.
            I looked at my local area and discovered at least 2 universities, one of the being Salford. I checked Salford out and saw
            that they did a Software Engineering degree, so I applied. Sadly, due to the banking crisis, I had no other choice but to decline
            the universities offer of a position in their Software Engineering degree.
            <br>

            I looked around for alternative places to study Software and found Open University, which is a company that does courses
            that you can do from your place of residence or anywhere with an internet connection. Sadly, after many attempts, I didn't pass.
            It was at this point that I was beginning to get very worried for my future and my prospects. Thankfully, after a bit of online searching,
            I found Treehouse! Upon finding Treehouse, I began to check what they offered. I saw that they offered code courses but not in Visual Basic.
            I found that they tought HTML, CSS and JavaScript instead, so I had almost no choice but to switch languages. I tried a few of
            their courses and discovered that I liked them, I also saw that they offered degrees called "Techdegrees" so I enrolled.

            <br>Since my enrollment onto the Techdegree, I have slowly made progress in learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript and now I'm not far
            from finishing the degree.
